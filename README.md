# Kibana reverse proxy       ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vidhya03/kibana-reverse-proxy.svg?branch=master)
This is an Spring boot application for Kibana reverse proxy in the form of a Java servlet.  An HTTP proxy is useful for AJAX applications to communicate with web accessible services on hosts other than where the web application is hosted.
# Kibana proxy configuration
> configure the kibana.yml and set the server.basePath as below

Kibana basepath - Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy. This only affects the URLs generated by Kibana, your proxy is expected to remove the basePath value before forwarding requests to Kibana. This setting cannot end in a slash. `server.basePath: "/kibanadashboard"` 

# Why
inspired by [this](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/6665#issuecomment-202574432)

> ` server.basePath is because the basepath should be removed by the proxy before requests are sent to Kibana. This is generally called "request rewriting" and any number of posts should exist to show you how to set that up for your proxy.`

# How to run
* clone repo
* Import into any of the IDE 
* configure the application.yml
  >  servlet_url: /kibanadashboard/*
  >
  >    target_url: http://kibana-host:port/
